# Mini SQL Projects

This repo will host all of my mini SQL projects.

## General steps I will follow for each mini project:
1. Find a dataset and examine it's features and data types.
2. Ask at least 5 interesting questions.
3. Load data into a database (PostgreSQL).
3. Answer the 5 questions using SQL and then visualize with Tableau.
